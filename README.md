# spring-framework-2.5

The purpose of this repository is to host the Spring Framework 2.5, referenced in the Spring MVC Step by Step tutorial. 

http://docs.spring.io/docs/Spring-MVC-step-by-step/

I got a copy of the zip file from here:

http://docs.spring.io/downloads/nightly/release-download.php?project=SPR

You can download a copy of the file from a command prompt like this:

wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/dist.springframework.org/release/SPR/spring-framework-2.5.1-with-dependencies.zip
